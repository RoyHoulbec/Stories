         <p>This was never meant for reading but the possbility that, in some place at sometime, someone is listening, makes my loneliness less complete. If you are out there my thoughts are with you. </p>

  <p> I wish I could have written poetry.<br>
            I wish I could have sat in a room <br>
            amid heaps of words,<br>
            and played with them <br>
            like a child plays with blocks.</p>
        
           <p> I wish I could press my heart upon the air <br>
            and it would play a rhythm <br>
            that was more than just <br>
            Beating.</p>

<p>
Brace yourself <br>
For the realization,<br>
To smack you across<br>
The face and<br>
Leave a cold lesson imprinted<br>
On your cheek.<br>
It says,<br>
This is not a story arc,<br>
This is not a parable,<br>
There’s no moral here,<br>
Fuck you.<br>
</p>

<p>
Faraway faces<br>
And miscounted graces,<br>
Keep my feet<br>
In time with my paces.<br>
As I walk from well lit places,<br>
Through rain spattered streets,<br>
Past terminal cases.</p>
<p>
I want to wring the night, from the clouds,<br>
into a cup and drink from it.<br>
Not for pleasure, but the satisfaction of an acquired taste.<br>
Alieving not which I know nor hate,<br>
but with a tried indifference accept.</p>
<p>
A receipt for something you did not want,<br>
Toss me as you can toss other things. <br>
So I matter no longer.<br>
So I am no longer required to be something which I don't know what it is.</p>

<p>
Now seen clear, <br>
it wafts and sways as if it will fall,<br>
This crystal chandelier.<br>
Its reflections are my thoughts.<br>
and when it crashes upon the floor,<br>
The innumerable pieces<br>
will gleam brighter than ever before.</p>

<p>
The library is vast. <br>
Its shelves reach in every direction.<br>
The books are many and their pages innumerable,<br>
but here at an obscure hour on an obscure page <br>
someone is reading these words.</p>

<p>
Where lie the hopes of great men.<br>
Amid pangs that echo in barrow halls,<br>
Softly chimes the requiem of our potential.<br>
To it still dusts plays out the aimless waltz,<br>
Each to no purpose, to no affliction, to no avail.</p>

  <h3>By Autocorrect</h3>
<p>
   Daybreak of your cheesy songs, from my house, is situated between two weeks of a sudden death penalty for nouns. I'll post on Craigslist for you, and you will have to wait until I have implicitly included all of the present. We need to be free of charge, to get back together again soon.

<h3> Ahab </h3>  
<p>    
Need it stand?<br>
Need it stand?<br>
for head in heart and heart in hand?<br>
Need the eucharists of the past, <br>
tip its hat to your deeds?<br>
No, I will not pedal in soft spoken pangs,<br>
Nor will I sigh by the river tossing pebbles among the reeds.<br>

I will shun the biddings of the quiet universe,<br>
I will abdicate in feverous silence the sins of the sun and of the stars,<br>
and by the light of a candle pass their punishment on a soft spoken page, <br>
In a single phrase,<br>
I will expunge the fallacies of my breeding.<br>
In a single word,<br>
I will inherit everything that was never promised to me.</p>

 <h3> The Great White Buffalo </h3>
<p>
I have seen the white buffalo<br>
and now I know it roams these hills,<br>
forsaken as I am.<br>
I search,<br>
I see it nought,<br>
except in my sleep.<br>
wandering in mysterious rhythms.<br>
keeping just out of reach.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
       <h3>Wake Up</h3>
<p> 
<i>Inside</i><br>
The day is all a buzz and hum<br>
And all a daze and all a drum<br>
And adverbs pile up<br>
like a list of things to be done<br>
like a pile of leaves baking in the sun<br>
On a not so autumn day. </p>
<p> 
Go look, go touch, go feel, it's bright outside!<br>
but you're pursuing your pillow<br>
For the comfiest spot<br>
With your alarm snoozing<br>
Ruminating on plate<br>
Served up to sleep<br>
But breakfast is sacred<br>
And the window is open<br>
And The shrubbery looks nice<br>
In the morning.</p>
<p> 
<i>Outside</i><br>
But where are the people, where are the places?<br>
I hear voices, I see faces?<br>
They are everywhere,<br>
following other currents of life,
of which I am not a part,
swimming past,<br>
into a river of bodies that somewhere must lead<br>
to a sea where there are many fish.</p>
<p> 

<i>Night</i><br>
Day is cacophony of light and sound.<br>
The night is punctuated.<br>
The night is for nouns.</p>
<p> 
Festooned faces<br>
fragile frowns<br>
Quite swimming simple sounds<br>
Shimmering places with simple bounds</p>
<p> 
Talk, laugh, <br>
Pray, listen. <br>
Do you hear you heart rate quicken?<br>
At the sound of nostalgic steps.</p>
<p> 
will you turn? <br>
And turn alast,<br>
To the look that looks not through or past.<br>
A moment, a smile, put in a cast,</p>
<p> 
Because it is inherently broken.</p>
<p> 
Will you see the present as it presented?</p>
<p> 
No, I am not forthcoming, I am not attentive<br>
the world is in many pieces<br>
And I don't know how they go together </p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
        
<h3>Language Barriers</h3>
<p>         
My guitar won't play what I tell it to.<br>
I’ve tried to learn some of its language <br>
But it won’t learn any of mine<br>
It makes my words feel clumsy and foolish<br>
I have seen it talk to other people<br>
and they have beautiful conversations.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
        
         
<h3>Gut Feeling</h3>       
<p>
Science has taught me<br>
to stand on the shoulders of great me,n<br>
and throw shit at the wall and see if it stick.s<br>
That were just gorillas and it’s turtles all the way down.</p>
