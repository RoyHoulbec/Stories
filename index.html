        <h1>Aperiodic Crystal Behavior in A Finite Energy Well: Local Minima</h1>
        <p></p>

        <p> I wish I could have written poetry.<br>
            I wish I could have sat in a room <br>
            amid heaps of words,<br>
            and played with them <br>
            like a child plays with blocks.<br>
            I wish I could press my heart upon the air <br>
            and it would play a rhythm <br>
            that was more than just <br>
            Beating.</p>

<p>
Brace yourself <br>
For the realization,<br>
To smack you across<br>
The face and<br>
Leave a cold lesson imprinted<br>
On your cheek.<br>
It says,<br>
This is not a story arc,<br>
This is not a parable,<br>
Thereâ€™s no moral here,<br>
Fuck you.<br>
</p>
<p>

<p>
Faraway faces<br>
And miscounted graces<br>
Keep my feet<br>
In time with my paces<br>
As I walk from well lit places<br>
Through rain spattered streets<br>
Past terminal cases.</p>
<p>
I would like to<br>
ring the night, from the clouds,<br>
into a cup and drink from it.<br>
Not for pleasure, but the satisfaction of an acquired taste.<br>
Alieving not which I know nor hate,<br>
but with a tried indifference accept.</p>
<p>
A receipt for something you did not want,<br>
Toss me as you can toss other things <br>
So I matter no longer<br>
So I am no longer required to be something which I don't know what it is.</p>
<p>

<a id="creating-pages-manually" class="anchor" href="#creating-pages-manually" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Cacophony</h3>

<p>
Now seen clear, <br>
it wafts and sways as if it will fall,<br>
This crystal chandelier.<br>
Its reflections are my thoughts.<br>
and when it crashes upon the floor,<br>
The innumerable pieces<br>
will gleam brighter than ever before.</p>
<p>

<p>
The library is vast <br>
its shelves reach in every direction<br>
The books are many and their pages innumerable<br>
but here at an obscure hour on an obscure page <br>
someone is reading these words</p>
<p>
<p>

<a id="support-or-contact" class="anchor" href="#support-or-contact" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Sarcophagi</h3>

<p>
Where lie the hopes of great men.<br>
Amid pangs that echo in barrow halls,<br>
Softly chimes the requiem of our potential.<br>
To it still dusts plays out the aimless waltz,<br>
Each to no purpose, to no affliction, to no avail.</p>
<p>

  <h3>By Autocorrect</h3>
<p>
   Daybreak of your cheesy songs, from my house, is situated between two weeks of a sudden death penalty for nouns. I'll post on Craigslist for you, and you will have to wait until I have implicitly included all of the present. We need to be free of charge, to get back together again soon.

<h3> Ahab </h3>  
<p>    
Need it stand?<br>
Need it stand?<br>
for head in heart and heart in hand?<br>
Need the eucharists of the past, <br>
tip its hat to your deeds?<br>
No, I will not pedal in soft spoken pangs,<br>
Nor will I sigh by the river tossing pebbles among the reeds.<br>

I will shun the biddings of the quiet universe,<br>
I will abdicate in feverous silence the sins of the sun and of the stars,<br>
and by the light of a candle pass their punishment on a soft spoken page, <br>
In a single phrase,<br>
I will expunge the fallacies of my breeding<br>
In a single word,<br>
I will inherit everything that was never promised to me.</p>
<p>    
<p>    
 <h3> THe Great White Buffalo </h3>
<p>
I have seen the white buffalo<br>
and now I know it roams these hills,<br>
forsaken as I am.<br>
I search,<br>
I see it nought,<br>
except in my sleep.<br>
wandering in mysterious rhythms.<br>
keeping just out of reach.</p>
